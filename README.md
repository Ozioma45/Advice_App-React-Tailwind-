## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - React framework
- [AdviceSlip](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - Advice api

### What I learned

Most importantly for me, this is a project to test my tailwind skills, surprisingly i must say am beginning to fall for the framework, the flexibility and arrangement is just nice. though am still trying to learn and master it am sure to build a lot more things with this technology.

and customizing the styles is my best part

```js
 theme: {
    colors: {
      "dark-blue": "hsl(218, 23%, 16%)",
      "dark-grayish": "hsl(217, 19%, 24%)",
      "grayish-blue": "hsl(217, 19%, 38%)",
      "neon-green": "hsl(150, 100%, 66%)",
      "light-cyan": "hsl(193, 38%, 86%)",
    },
    boxShadow: {
      "neon-green": "2px 3px 25px hsl(150, 100%, 66%)", // Adjust the shadow as needed
    },
    fontFamily: {
      manrope: ["Manrope", "sans-serif"],
    },}
```

### Continued development

i am now enjoying and getting to know more about reactjs and tailwind. S urely, i would build more with these technology
